Abstract
--------

The `C10k problem`_ is still a puzzle for a programmer to find a way to solve
it. Generally, developers deal with extensive I/O operations via **thread**,
**epoll**, or **kqueue** to avoid their software waiting for an expensive task.
However, developing a readable and bug-free concurrent code is challenging due
to data sharing and job dependency. Even though some powerful tools, such as
`Valgrind`_, help developers to detect deadlock or other asynchronous issues,
solving these problems may be time-consuming when the scale of software grows
large. Therefore, many programming languages such as Python, Javascript, or C++
dedicated to developing better libraries, frameworks, or syntaxes to assist
programmers in managing concurrent jobs properly. Instead of focusing on how to
use modern parallel APIs, this article mainly concentrates on the design
philosophy behind programming patterns.

Introduction
------------

Handling I/O operations such as network connections is one of the most expensive
tasks in a program. Take a simple TCP blocking echo server as an example
(The following snippet). If a client connects to the server successfully without
sending any request, it blocks others' connections. Even though clients send data
as soon as possible, the server cannot handle other requests if there is no
client tries to establish a connection. Also, handling multiple requests is
inefficient because it wastes a lot of time waiting for I/O responses from
hardware such as network interfaces. Thus, socket programming with concurrency
becomes inevitable to manage extensive requests.

.. code-block:: python

    import socket

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 5566))
    s.listen(10)

    while True:
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        msg = conn.recv(1024)
        conn.send(msg)

One possible solution to prevent a server waiting for I/O operations is to
dispatch tasks to other threads. The following example shows how to create a
thread to handle connections simultaneously. However, creating numerous threads
may consume all computing power without high throughput. Even worse, an
application may waste time waiting for a lock to process critical sections within
a thread. Although using threads can solve blocking issues for a socket server,
other factors, such as CPU utilization, are essential for a programmer to
overcome the C10k problem. Therefore, without creating unlimited threads, the
event loop is another solution to manage connections.

.. code-block:: python

    import threading
    import socket

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 5566))
    s.listen(10240)

    def handler(conn):
        while True:
            msg = conn.recv(65535)
            conn.send(msg)

    while True:
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        t = threading.Thread(target=handler, args=(conn,))
        t.start()

A simple event-driven socket server includes three main components: an I/O
multiplexing module (e.g., `select`_), a scheduler (loop), and callback
functions (events). For example, the following server utilizes the high-level
I/O multiplexing, `selectors`_, within a loop to check whether an I/O operation
is ready or not. If data is available to read/write, the loop acquires I/O
events and execute callback functions, ``accept``, ``read``, or ``write``, to
finish tasks.

.. code-block:: python

    import socket

    from selectors import DefaultSelector
    from selectors import EVENT_READ, EVENT_WRITE
    from functools import partial

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 5566))
    s.listen(10240)
    s.setblocking(False)

    sel = DefaultSelector()

    def accept(s, mask):
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        conn.setblocking(False)
        sel.register(conn, EVENT_READ, read)

    def read(conn, mask):
        msg = conn.recv(65535)
        if not msg:
            sel.unregister(conn)
            return conn.close()
        sel.modify(conn, EVENT_WRITE, partial(write, msg=msg))

    def write(conn, mask, msg=None):
        if msg:
            conn.send(msg)
        sel.modify(conn, EVENT_READ, read)

    sel.register(s, EVENT_READ, accept)
    while True:
        events = sel.select()
        for e, m in events:
            cb = e.data
            cb(e.fileobj, m)

Although managing connections via threads may not be efficient, a program that
utilizes an event loop to schedule tasks isnâ€™t easy to read. To enhance code
readability, many programming languages, including Python, introduce abstract
concepts such as coroutine, future, or async/await to handle I/O multiplexing.
To better understand programming jargon and using them correctly, the following
sections discuss what these concepts are and what kind of problems they try to
solve.

Callback Functions
------------------

A callback function is used to control data flow at runtime when an event is
invoked. However, preserving current callback function's status is challenging.
For example, if a programmer wants to implement a handshake over a TCP server,
he/she may requires to store previous status in some where.

.. code-block:: python

    import socket

    from selectors import DefaultSelector
    from selectors import EVENT_READ, EVENT_WRITE
    from functools import partial

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 5566))
    s.listen(10240)
    s.setblocking(False)

    sel = DefaultSelector()
    is_hello = {}

    def accept(s, mask):
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        conn.setblocking(False)
        is_hello[conn] = False;
        sel.register(conn, EVENT_READ, read)

    def read(conn, mask):
        msg = conn.recv(65535)
        if not msg:
            sel.unregister(conn)
            return conn.close()

        # check whether handshake is successful or not
        if is_hello[conn]:
            sel.modify(conn, EVENT_WRITE, partial(write, msg=msg))
            return

        # do a handshake
        if msg.decode("utf-8").strip() != "hello":
            sel.unregister(conn)
            return conn.close()

        is_hello[conn] = True

    def write(conn, mask, msg=None):
        if msg:
            conn.send(msg)
        sel.modify(conn, EVENT_READ, read)

    sel.register(s, EVENT_READ, accept)
    while True:
        events = sel.select()
        for e, m in events:
            cb = e.data
            cb(e.fileobj, m)



Although the variable ``is_hello`` assists in storing status to check whether a
handshake is successful or not, the code becomes harder for a programmer to
understand. In fact, the concept of the previous implementation is equal to the
following snippet.

.. code-block:: python

    def accept(s, mask):
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        conn.setblocking(False)
        success = handshake(conn)
        if not success:
            conn.close()

    def handshake(conn):
        data = conn.recv(65535)
        if not data:
            return False
        if data.decode('utf-8').strip() != "hello":
            return False
        conn.send(b"hello")
        return True

What is a Coroutine?
--------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import inspect
    import types

    from functools import wraps
    from asyncio.futures import Future

    def coroutine(func):
        """Simple prototype of coroutine"""
        if inspect.isgeneratorfunction(func):
            return types.coroutine(func)

        @wraps(func)
        def coro(*a, **k):
            res = func(*a, **k)
            if isinstance(res, Future) or inspect.isgenerator(res):
                res = yield from res
            return res
        return types.coroutine(coro)

    @coroutine
    def foo():
        yield from asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("Hello Foo")

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(loop.create_task(foo()))
    loop.close()
